# Jamagax's Rhino and Grasshopper Scripts
Welcome to Jamagax's repository of scripts and definitions for Rhino and Grasshopper. This repository contains a collection of codes that can help to improve the 3D modeling workflow in Rhino by simplifying common tasks or repetitive processes for a pipeline.

Please note that some of the files in this repository are exercises, others are modifications from other codes, and some of them are experiments of AI programming code. These codes are shared here for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started
In order to use these scripts, you will need to have Rhino and Grasshopper installed on your computer. You can download Rhino for free from the Rhino website and Grasshopper can be downloaded as a plug-in for Rhino.

Once you have Rhino and Grasshopper set up, you can use the scripts in this repository by opening them in Rhino and running them. Some scripts are in Python and others are in Grasshopper.

## Running Rhino Python scripts
To run the Rhino Python scripts, you can use the built-in Python editor in Rhino. Here are the steps to run a script:

Open Rhino and type "EditPythonScript" in the command line to open the Python editor.
In the Python editor, click the "New" button to create a new script.
Paste the script code into the new script and save it with a meaningful name.
Click the "Run" button to run the script.
Please keep in mind that some scripts may require user input or selection in the Rhino viewport, so make sure to follow the prompts in the script and in Rhino.

## Repository Contents
The scripts and definitions in this repository are organized into different categories based on their function. Here is a brief overview of the contents of the repository:

Exercises: These are scripts and definitions that were created as part of an exercise or tutorial. They may not be fully functional or optimized for real-world use.

Modifications: These are scripts and definitions that have been modified from existing code. They may have been adapted to suit a specific use case or to add new functionality.

Experiments: These are scripts and definitions that are experimental in nature and may not be fully functional or reliable. These scripts are focused on testing out new concepts or technologies such as AI in Rhino and Grasshopper.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. We welcome any contributions that can improve the functionality or usability of the scripts in this repository.

## Support
If you have any questions or issues with the scripts in this repository, please open an issue in the repository. We will do our best to provide support and address any issues that arise.

## Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that these codes are shared here for educational and demonstration purposes, and not for production use. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the code is free of errors or that it will work as expected in all cases. Use them at your own risk.

## Thanks
Thank you for visiting this repository and we hope that these scripts and definitions will be useful in your 3D modeling workflow.
